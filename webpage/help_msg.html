<h2>Requirements for a Node to be displayed on this map</h2>
<ol>
<li>It must be a real Node. Reserved addresses and advertised services will not display.</li>
<li>It must be reachable over the Mesh Network by this server.</li>
<li>It must be running AREDN code 3.16.0.1 or later. Earlier AREDN code, all BBHN code, and HSMM-Pi will not display.</li>
<li>It must have its Latitude and Longitude recorded on the Basic Setup configuration page within the node.
<br>
(This does not mean that the node has to register with the AREDN map server.
<br>
It only means that the node must know where it is located.)</li>
<li>The node must have been seen within the last 30 days by this server.
<br>
Nodes not seen for 30 days are purged from the database.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p><b>Troubleshooting why a node does not show up.</b></p>
<p>In most cases of a node not showing up on the map it is because the latitude and longitude has not been entered into the node.
<br>To check this, run the following in a browser for the node in question:
<br />
<pre>http://nodename.local.mesh:8080/cgi-bin/sysinfo.json</pre>
<br>
In the file that is produced, look for <code>lat:</code> and <code> lon:</code>.
<br>
If one or both are empty, then the node does not know its latitude and longitude and can not tell the map where it is located.
<br>
Simply put, if the map can not determine a location for a node, it can not put it on the map.
<br>
(How can you place a marker on a map without knowing where it is?)
<br>
<p><b>If you have multiple nodes in one location:</b></p>
You will only see one node on the map if you have more than 1 with the same coordinates.
<br>
This issue is being worked on.
<br>
For now, either slightly change the nodes lat and lon in the settings page, or try to use the <a href='admin/admin.php'>'admin'</a> interface.
<br>
The admin interface will allow you to change a nodes location without having to login to the node itself.
<br>
Please read the text on the admin pages for tips on using it.
