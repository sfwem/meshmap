    Autorefresh is back!
    There is a new button at upper left on the map.
    (this button can be disabled if needed)
    Now you can toggle the autorefresh on and off now.
    It is set to refresh after 10 minutes.

    Bugfixes/Changes
    
    Removed an errant "echo" that would cause output in "silent" mode.
    
    When the polling script parsed through the interfaces looking for the
    wlan MAC address and ip (and the LAN ip) it always had issues with the
    different versions of the json file on different firmwares.
    I think this has finally been solved.
    The polling script should pull the proper info from even a 3.15.1.0 node
    now and if those nodes have location info they should now appear on the
    map too.
    The admins of those devices should be strongly reminded to update!!
    
    I mistakenly removed the red and green dot from the status area of the
    admin page. They are restored now.
    
    Parallel node polling will work now, but it is not recommended on large
    networks, as there is still no control over how many scripts are
    spawned. Small networks of should be just fine.
    (this has been tested many times on a network of 20-30 (sometimes 100's)
    with no issues)
    Use at your own risk though.
    
    New warnings in "Test Mode" to alert when a nodes location has been
    "fixed" or not. It's very noticable now.
    
    Some general clean up/typo fixing and removal of things that were long
    due for removal.
    
    fixed some file attributes.
    
    Added some things to be used in the near future but are not done yet.

    BugFixs/Enhancements/Additions
    
    Can change the non mesh markers info without having to recreate now.
    
    The polling script can now find the info for some nodes that it could
    not before, such as firmware 3.15.1.0b4, this was a pleasant side effect
    of trying to remove some of the bunk entries i nthe database.
    
    The polling script will now also try to check and "fix" the database,
    this is due to changes in the newer AREDN firmwares (anything beyond
    3.17RC1)
    Some of those changes were made by me, just for the map. :)
    These DB "fixes" also include removing some columns that were no longer
    and were making the DB much larger than it needs to be, this will also
    help cut down on the memory footprint when loading the webpage.
    
    The numbers at the bottom of the map reflecting nodes and link, should
    be more accurate now (I hope).
    
    The Map legend has been change to use pure HTML5/CSS, the only images
    are the small circle icons, this may cause issues with very old
    browsers...
    
    Removed some files that were no longer needed or forgetten about.

    Also, changed the bottom attribution layer to better fit on small
    screens.

    but for now a quick addition to allow the map to be shown on sbarc.org
    again.

    BugFix get-map-info wxc_functions
    
    Fixed the "ignored nodes" check. Nodes and devices that get ignored due
    to 404/no route to host/connection refused errors, will now be properly,
    and temporarily skipped over by the polling script.

    BugFix: More 5GHz channels, 900MHz nodes now found by 'board_id'
    
    Added 'non-US' 5GHz channel numbers.
    
    Device band was determined by channel, 900MHz and 2.4GHz have some of
    the same channel number and the script had a hard time telling which was
    which.
    This has (hopefully) been fixed now. Since there are only 3 AREDN
    compatible 900MHz devices, it was easier to just find those certain
    board_id's. This also allowed channel #4 to be added back into the list
    for 2.4GHz. (yes it was a hack but mostly worked :) )
    
    Additionally, I've been trying to optimize the map_function.inc file.
    A couple of the functions in that file consume 90%+ of the time it takes
    to render the webpage. (load_LinkedTO() is a beast!)
    On the cloud server this can sometimes completely stall the script(s)
    and fail to load the page at all.

    BugFix/Enhancement export2csv admin-default.css
    
    Fixed export2csv to deal with the json data better.
    I still cannot get the exported CSV file to cleanly import back into
    SQL, but it's *way* better than it was before.
    Still working on this.
    
    admin-default.css has had the header are set to fixed height.
    Hopefully things will be visiable for all browsers/screens now.
    
    Also updates to the readme file from earlier.

    Bugfix/Update/Enhancement Admin pages
    
    Finally finished a rough version of some admin pages that allow for
    maintenance of the DB, fixing node locations, removing nodes, etc...
    Username/Password is required to use the admin pages.
    You must create an intial user/password.
    When you first load the admin page it will ask you to create an initial
    user.
    This initial user is a "super user" and will be able to create other
    users.
    (more info is on the admin pages themselves)
    
    Fixed a stupid mistake in export2csv.php.
    
    Rearranged the columns in the node_info datebase which make the data
    more readable when exported as CSV file.
    
    Removed old DB columns that were now unused.
    
    Changed the *.css-default file(s) to *-default.css so that IE will use
    them without complaints.
    
    More than a few other little changes here and there...

    Enhancement: map_display.php
    
    The check for internet access was using a POST variable to tell the page
    if the client had access to the internet or not (it just tries to get
    favicon.ico from google).
    The problem with POST was that every time you refreshed the page, the
    POST variable had to be resent, usually resulting in a dialog box from
    the browser ("Do you want to resend this info?")
    
    This drove me crazy, I could not stand that dialog box.
    
    The check for internet access has been changed to use a cookie.
    The cookie contains 1 item and expires after 30 minutes.
    So after 30 minutes, the page will recheck for internet access and act
    accordingly.
    
    There is also a small change to the check for user-settings.ini.
    
    The README.md/html files were slightly updated as well.

    Bug Fix: get-map-info.php, map-display.php
    
    Due to commit before this I also noticed non-nodes were being put into
    the database.
    There were over a 100 in my database alone.
    These are most likely non-node devices and will never be able to be
    mapped.
    Initially, I opted for a "save and recheck" style of polling, in the
    hopes that something was just missed and it would get picked up later.
    This is not the case and over time I think can see what is happening.
    
    added a check in get-map-info.php to try and skip these devices if we
    reach one, and due to that change, the numbers of shown and not show
    node and links at the bottom right of the map is more accuate now (I
    hope).

    Bug fix: get-map-info.php
    
    Some nodes returned a blank lat,lon and grid_square differently than
    others that were also blank.
    
    This was causing issues when writing to the SQL database.
    get-map-info would throw this error when it would happen:
    "Could not send to SQL. Incorrect double value: '' for column 'lat' at
    row 1"
    
    Fix:
    Any blank lat || lon now get converted to a single "0".
    Any blank grid_square now gets converted to a NULL.

    Changed to use default ini and other user editable files.
    
    There is no longer a user-files.tar.gz file!
    
    The user must remove the "-default" from the file extension, save the
    file and then make their own changes. I have seen many other programs
    use this and it seems to make sense.
    The README has been updated to reflect this change.
    Other ideas are appreciated still! :)
    
    With the exception of user-settings.ini, the code will check for the
    existance of the non "-default" files and use those instead of the
    default ones.
    Also if the user does not create a user-settings.ini file of their own
    an error will be thrown telling them such.
    
    Fixed the Popup for "total number of link" in the attributon bar.
    
    Some new values were added to the meshmap.css file in order to make it
    easier for the user to make customizations to the page if they want.
    More of these will probably be added in the future.

    Setting up for the abilty to tell if the client has internet access or
    not.
    
    There is a way to have javascript give us some indication if the clients
    browser has access to the greater internet or not. This would allow the
    map webpage to either pull it's local resources or to use resources from
    the internet.
    For 1 you can get better Map layers if the client has internet access,
    and why pull data over the mesh if we do not have to?

    get-map-info, map_display and map_functions updated.
    
    Added "ini_set('memory_limit', '128M') to get-map-info and map_display.
    If you have a large network, you may need to increase the amount of
    memory needed. 128M should be more than enough in most cases, unless you
    have a "Mega Mesh" like N2MH does. :)
    
    Added "last_seen" info to the station popups (map_functions.inc)
    
    Also added (hopefully) a catch in get-map-info to find a "stalled" node
    polling run.
    Sometimes the node polling portion of the script never completes and it
    never gets a chance to unset the "currently_running" bit in the
    database.
    There is now a check so that if the "currently_running" bit is 1 and the
    time the script last polled the node is greater than 3 * the
    "node_polling_interval" (from the ini file), then the script will just
    go out and poll the nodes as normal.
    If it completes, it will unset the "currently_running" bit and will
    update the timestamp.
    
    These changes have all been suggested by N2MH. Thanks Mark! I finally
    got to it!

    Remove usage of the "wxc_custom.inc" file.
    
    There is now a new file: "custom.inc" that can allow the user to make
    site specific overrides, keep sql passwords out of the main ini file,
    etc...
    This is completely optional and not required. The file may even be
    safely deleted if wanted.
    
    Also some typo fixing in the README file.

    Many changes.
    
    Removed user-edited files so they do not get overwritten when updating
    the scripts.
    The user-edited files are now contained in the user-file.tar.gz archive.
    Once decompressed they will not be effected by future "git pull"
    operations.
    
    Made changes to how the scripts find the included files, the whole thing
    can now just live in one directory, allowing for easier future updates.
    
    Added http-meshmap.conf file to plug in to apache configs. This allows
    the <WEBROOT>/meshmap directory to live virtually anywhere on the
    filesystem.
    
    Updated README file to reflect these new instructions.

    creation

    Fixed issues with the station Pop-Ups.
    
    The array that was fixed for PHP 7.2.3 was not fixed right.
    This resulted in missing/inaccurate info in the station pop-ups.
    
    Part of the array was reinitializing when it should not have, since it
    was already created at that point.
    
    a pretty simple if (is_array()) { ... }else { ... } fixes it.

    working on load_LinkedTO function.
    
    load_LinkerTO blows up in php7 due to the array not being created
    correctly.
    php5 just happily fixed it for us and did not complain.
    The issue is somewhat dealt with, Eric is still working on it.
    
    This commit is also a test of the git system.
    cheers!
